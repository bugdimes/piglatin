# Ruby Gem for Pig Latin Translations

Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway.

    $ gem install piglatin

## Usage

You can call `pig_latin_convert` on a String to convert to its Pig Latin Equivalent
